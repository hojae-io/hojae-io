## Hi there, I'm Ho Jae ðŸ‘‹

Hello, everyone. This is Ho Jae Lee! :slightly_smiling_face:
I am currently studying at [MIT](https://mit.edu/) for my Ph.D. degree focusing on Robotics.
I graduated from [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) for my Master's degree in [Robotics, Systems and Control](https://master-robotics.ethz.ch/) :book:

My research interest is to develop reinforcement learning algorithms for locomition & manipulation for quadrupedal & bipedal robot.

### Some of the past project..

* During my bachelor thesis, I built my own DJI drone and developed autonomous delivery algorithms using Visual Odometry.

* For my semester project at RSL, I developed algorithms for learning human-robot handover skills from human demonstrations using deep RL.
